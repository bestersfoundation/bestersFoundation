            <h3>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h3>
            <p>
                Carla Chapman started The Besterâ€™s Foundation Inc. with a clear mission in mind. To relieve the
                communities of Atlanta
                of homelessness. She is a native of this city, and has witnessed first hand what has happened and what
                can be done.
                Carla has always been active in the community, and an avid caretaker of those with special needs before
                taking on
                starting a nonprofit. Her compassion, and perseverance to see the best in those around her makes her the
                perfect fit to
                lead us to our mission. Carla works alongside her husband of 33years, three children, and a group of
                volunteers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our passion here is to repair families by providing assistance and rehabilitate those experiencing
                homelessness by
                providing programs like Hearts need homes. We understand that the difference between stability and
                homelessness is only
                a couple missed payments. We want to use financial assistance and societal readiness courses to stir our
                clients back on
                track.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of our long-term goals will be to provide long-term stability to families by renovating abandoned
                buildings
                throughout the metro atlanta area. We found that most shelters are either for women & children or men
                only. We want to
                establish a place where families or familiar units can rehabilitate together. We plan to build our
                expertise and
                database of clients by providing outpatient services first which will include bill assistance, a food
                pantry, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Metro Atlanta area includes surrounding counties including Dekalb county. We hope to find families
                and/or familiar
                units (a group of two or more individuals who are not a traditional family by standards of marriage or
                birth).
